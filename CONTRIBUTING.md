# Contributing to PolterType

Thanks for the interest! This document covers the practical bits;
the architecture lives in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) and
[docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md).

## Building locally

```bash
# Default build (no AI subsystem)
cargo build -p poltertype-app

# Run
cargo run -p poltertype-app

# With the AI subsystem compiled in. This does NOT turn AI on: the crate
# ships stubs (LocalOnnxDetector / RemoteLlmDetector) that nothing
# constructs, so the flag changes no behaviour today. See docs/AI.md.
cargo build -p poltertype-app --features ai

# With AI + the remote HTTP capability compiled in (still unreachable —
# the client is built and never used)
cargo build -p poltertype-app --features ai,poltertype-ai/remote

# Lints (CI runs the same)
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

## `cargo xtask`

The `xtask` subcommand is wired up via a cargo alias in
[`.cargo/config.toml`](.cargo/config.toml) — no `cargo install` step
needed, the alias is loaded automatically from any directory inside
the workspace. If you previously did `cargo install cargo-xtask`
because of older docs, that's an unrelated stub package — uninstall
it with `cargo uninstall cargo-xtask` so it doesn't shadow our alias.

```bash
cargo xtask help            # list available subcommands
cargo xtask wordlists fetch # re-fetch + Hunspell-expand bundled dictionaries
cargo xtask hooks install   # see below
cargo xtask hooks uninstall
cargo xtask assets icon-png <out> [--size N]   # render the placeholder app icon
```

## Git hooks (one-time per clone)

```bash
cargo xtask hooks install
```

Wires the versioned hooks under [`.githooks/`](.githooks/):

| Hook | Runs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check` + `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | No commits with formatter drift or lint violations. |
| `pre-push` | `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` | No pushes that don't compile. |

Bypass a single run with `git commit --no-verify` / `git push
--no-verify` if you really need to. Uninstall everything with
`cargo xtask hooks uninstall`.

The hooks mirror the gates CI enforces, so failing locally means
failing on GitHub Actions — better to know in 2 seconds than in
2 minutes after a push.

### Linux native deps

Ubuntu / Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    pkg-config libdbus-1-dev libudev-dev \
    libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev \
    libwayland-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxtst-dev libxdo-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev libasound2-dev
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install \
    pkg-config dbus-devel libudev-devel \
    libxkbcommon-devel libxkbcommon-x11-devel \
    wayland-devel libX11-devel libXi-devel libXtst-devel libxdo-devel \
    gtk3-devel libayatana-appindicator-gtk3-devel alsa-lib-devel
```

On **Wayland**, run `scripts/setup-linux.sh` once to grant
`/dev/input/event*` + `/dev/uinput` access. On **X11** you need
nothing at all — no `input` group, no udev rule, no `sudo`. See
[docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) for the rationale.

### macOS

System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable
`poltertype` (or your `cargo run` debug binary). The app will fail
to install its CGEventTap until that's granted.

### Windows

Just `cargo run`. SmartScreen may complain about the unsigned
binary — releases are still unsigned; code signing is tracked for a
later phase.

## Project layout

```
crates/
  poltertype-app/      binary  — tray + event loop + plumbing + Settings UI
  poltertype-core/    library — engine, settings, layouts, data_dir, audio
  poltertype-input/   library — InputListener / KeyEmitter trait + per-OS
  poltertype-layout/  library — LayoutSwitcher trait + per-OS
  poltertype-detect/  library — Detector / WordRewriter traits + built-ins
  poltertype-update/  library — GitHub-Releases updater: manifest, download,
                                staging, per-OS install. NOT optional — it is
                                in every build, and it is the only network code
  poltertype-popup/   library — suggestion tooltip: focus-free overlay
                                (Wayland layer-shell / X11 override-redirect)
  poltertype-tray/    library — per-OS tray quirks (Linux: keeps the GTK
                                backend's deprecation warning off stderr)
  poltertype-ai/      library — optional AI plug-ins (feature `ai`)
  poltertype-types/   library — shared types (LayoutId, KeyEvent, …)
data/                source-of-truth, committed; consumed by build.rs

```

`crates/poltertype-core/build.rs` reads from `data/` and writes prepared
assets (FSTs + copied TOMLs + copied stop-word txts) to
`<workspace>/target/dist/data/` on every cargo build. The runtime
finds that tree via `poltertype_core::data_dir::resolve()`. Installer
scripts copy `target/dist/data/` into the install location. See
[docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md](docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md) for the full picture.

## Settings UI

Tray menu **"Settings…"** opens an iced-based GUI with seven panes:
**Languages**, **Hotkeys**, **Commands**, **Wordlists**, **General**,
**Exceptions**, **About**. Power users still hit **"Edit
config.toml…"** for what the GUI doesn't expose (creating a wordlist
profile, bulk-editing `[[commands]]`, `[updates].check_interval_hours`
— the General pane has the on/off checkbox but not the interval — and
the `[ai]` switches).

The Settings GUI is the same `poltertype` binary launched with
`--settings`; it runs as a child process so the tray's main-thread
event loop doesn't have to share NSApplication on macOS. When the
window closes the tray reloads settings automatically.

## Adding a new keyboard layout

1. Drop a TOML into `data/layout-mappings/` named after the BCP-47
   tag (`de_de.toml`, `kk_cyrl_kz.toml`, …). Use one of the existing
   files as a template.
2. Add the same stem to `LAYOUTS` in `crates/poltertype-core/build.rs` (so
   build.rs copies it) AND to `BUNDLED_LAYOUT_STEMS` in
   `crates/poltertype-core/src/layouts/consts.rs` (so the runtime considers it).
3. Send a PR. No further Rust changes are required for the engine
   to start considering the new layout — the file is the contract.

If your language has unusual vowels not covered by
`derive_vowels()` in `crates/poltertype-core/src/layouts/helpers.rs`, extend that
function with a special case.

## Style & guarantees (hard rules)

* `clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` must pass.
* No `unwrap()` / `expect()` outside tests, build scripts, or `main`.
* Never log user-typed text in release builds. The word buffer is
  RAM-only and short-lived.
* The OS hook callback never blocks — events go straight onto a
  `crossbeam-channel`; the engine processes them on a worker thread.
* Platform code lives behind `cfg`-gated modules in `poltertype-input` and
  `poltertype-layout`. No `#[cfg(target_os = "…")]` outside those crates.

## File organization (one kind of thing per file)

Don't mix tests, data types, and free functions in one file. When a
module grows past a single concern, split it into a directory module
with these conventional file names:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `mod.rs` / `lib.rs` | module docs, `mod` declarations, `pub use` re-exports — wiring only |
| `consts.rs` | constants |
| `enums.rs` | enums (and their small `impl`s) |
| `types.rs` | plain data structs (and their small `impl`s) |
| `<purpose>.rs` | free functions grouped by purpose (`heuristics.rs`, `helpers.rs`, `files.rs`, …) |
| `<Type in snake_case>.rs` | a struct with substantial behaviour lives in its own file together with its `impl` (e.g. `db.rs`) |
| `tests.rs` | **all** unit tests — never inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { … }` blocks in source files |

When such a type file outgrows a couple of screenfuls (~400+ lines),
promote it to its own directory module: the struct with its fields and
constructor in one file, and the `impl` split into one block per
concern, one file per block (fields and cross-file methods become
`pub(super)`). Example: `crates/poltertype-core/src/engine/switcher/`
(`engine.rs` — the struct; `run_loop.rs`, `echo.rs`, `decide.rs`,
`correction.rs`, `commands.rs` — one concern each).

Unit tests always live in a sibling `tests.rs`, declared from the
parent as `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`. Existing examples to copy from:
`crates/poltertype-core/src/engine/`, `crates/poltertype-core/src/layouts/`,
`crates/poltertype-detect/src/`, `crates/poltertype-app/src/settings_ui/`.

## Commits

Imperative mood, scope prefix when useful (`engine:`, `win:`, `ui:`,
`ai:`). Reference the phase or doc when the change is design-bearing.

## Releasing

> **Read [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) first — all of it.**
> In particular step 2: **syncing the docs is a release blocker.** No
> tag ships while `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` still describe
> the previous release. Nothing in CI will catch it for you.

Releases are cut by pushing a `v*` tag. CI ([release.yml]) then
builds three installers in parallel and attaches them to a draft
GitHub Release, along with `latest.json` — the manifest the in-app
updater polls, generated from the exact artifacts being uploaded so
the checksums cannot drift out of step with the files:

| Platform | Artifact | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (x86_64) | `.AppImage` | `linuxdeploy` + appimage plugin |
| macOS (universal: Intel + Apple Silicon) | `.dmg` | `lipo` + `hdiutil` |
| Windows (x86_64) | `.msi` | WiX Toolset 3 (`candle` + `light`) |
| all three | `latest.json` | generated in [release.yml] |

Publishing the draft is what ships the update to **every existing
user** — the updater resolves `releases/latest`, which skips drafts and
pre-releases. Sanity-check the artifacts before you publish, not after.

The packaging logic lives in [`installers/`](installers/) so it can
also be run locally — useful when adjusting the WiX template or the
DMG layout without round-tripping through GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Linux
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -p poltertype-app
cargo xtask assets icon-png target/dist/icon-256.png --size 256
VERSION=local ICON_PNG=target/dist/icon-256.png \
    bash installers/linux/build-appimage.sh

# macOS (run on a Mac)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin   -p poltertype-app
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin  -p poltertype-app
VERSION=local \
    BIN_X86_64=target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/poltertype \
    BIN_ARM64=target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/poltertype \
    bash installers/macos/build-dmg.sh

# Windows
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -p poltertype-app
choco install wixtoolset --no-progress -y   # one-time
$env:VERSION = 'local'
pwsh installers/windows/build-msi.ps1
```

Installers are **unsigned** — we don't yet have an Apple Developer
ID or a Windows EV/OV cert. The release notes call out the
Gatekeeper / SmartScreen workarounds so users know what to click.

To cut a release: see [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for
the full step-by-step checklist (pre-flight, version bump,
commit + tag + push, recovery from common mistakes). The TL;DR
is at the bottom of that doc if you've cut releases before and
just need the command sequence.

## Reporting bugs / asking for things

GitHub Issues — please attach:

* `poltertype --version`
* OS / DE / session type
* If the engine's behaviour is surprising, the relevant lines from
  `<config-dir>/poltertype/logs/` (the tray's "Open Logs" entry
  takes you there).
