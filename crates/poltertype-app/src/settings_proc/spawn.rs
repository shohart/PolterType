/// Spawn the Settings GUI as a child process (`poltertype
/// --settings`) and refresh the engine when the window closes.
/// Subprocess instead of in-process for the macOS main-thread
/// reason documented at the top of `settings_ui/mod.rs`.
///
/// What "refresh" means in practice — we run all three on close so
/// every kind of edit the user could have made via the GUI takes
/// effect by the time the focus returns to their app:
///
/// 1. **`config.toml` reload** — picks up `[[commands]]` text-trigger
///    entries, hotkey rebindings, exception list edits, profile
///    schema changes.
/// 2. **Global wordlist reload** — `<config-dir>/wordlists/<stem>.txt`
///    re-read; the engine's dictionary set swapped via
///    `DictionaryDetector::replace_dicts` (same primitive the tray
///    "Reload Settings" entry uses).
/// 3. **Per-profile wordlist cache rebuild + force-reapply** — the
///    profile dictionary cache is rebuilt from disk, and we set the
///    watcher's `force_reapply` flag so the *currently active*
///    profile's freshly-loaded dicts get re-applied on the next tick
///    (~250 ms). Without this, the watcher only swaps on profile
///    transitions, so a user editing words while focused on a
///    profiled app would see no effect until they alt-tabbed away
///    and back.
///
/// If we can't spawn at all we tell the user so with a notification
/// rather than only a log line: the click produced no window, and a
/// tray app has nowhere else to put an error.
