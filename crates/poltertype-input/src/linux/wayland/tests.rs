//! Unit tests for the evdev backend's decision-making: the key gate
//! and the rescan bookkeeping.
//!
//! Neither can be exercised against real hardware from a test — one
//! grabs keyboards, the other watches `/dev/input` — so both are driven
//! through the seams they were given for it: [`GateDevice`] for the
//! gate, and a pure path-diff for the rescan. Every case here is a
//! regression: each one cost real text on a real machine before it was
