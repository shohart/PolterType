///   |----30ms----| |--10ms--|       |--25ms--| |----60ms----|
/// ```
///
/// Why both ramp envelopes AND silence padding:
///
/// * **Ramp envelopes** (10 ms in, 25 ms out) prevent sample-level
///   discontinuity at sine wave start / end. Cutting a sine mid-cycle
///   is a hard-edge step the speaker reproduces as a click.
/// * **Lead silence** absorbs OS audio-stack warmup the *first* time
///   we hand audio to a freshly-opened `OutputStream` (or to one
///   that's been idle long enough to have unrouted itself on some
///   platforms). Without it, the fade-in is partly eaten by device
///   init and the user hears a tone that begins mid-rise.
/// * **Tail silence** gives the OS audio buffer time to flush the
///   final real samples before `sleep_until_end` returns and the
///   sink drops; with the long-lived stream design that flush time
///   is short, but the cushion costs nothing audible.
///
/// Why we render the envelope by hand instead of using rodio's
/// chainable `fade_in` / `fade_out`: rodio 0.20's `Source::fade_out`
/// starts ramping at sample 0 and reaches silence at `duration` —
/// the opposite of what the name suggests. Computing the envelope
/// ourselves is safer and locks the behaviour into our own tests.
