# PolterType

Cross-platform automatic keyboard layout switcher.
Lives in the system tray. Detects when you start typing in the wrong
layout, switches it, and retypes the last word — like a friendly
poltergeist that haunts your keyboard.

> **Status:** v0.6.2 — out of beta since v0.1.0. Works end-to-end on
> Windows, on Linux (both Wayland and X11), and on macOS (validated
> on macOS 15 / Intel: listener, layout switching, corrections); the
> spelling-suggestions tooltip renders on Hyprland/Sway and X11. On
> Linux/Wayland a correction now holds your keystrokes back while it
> types and replays them behind itself, so carrying straight on with
> the next word no longer scrambles the result — except behind an
> input remapper such as keyd, where PolterType stands down and falls
> back to detecting and repairing instead
> ([docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md)). Installers are still
> **unsigned**. See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the full plan and
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's in.

*The settings window (`poltertype --settings`). Day to day the app is
just a tray icon; you open this window only to tweak languages,
hotkeys, smart commands, wordlists, and per-app exceptions.*

## Goals

- **Smart** — language detection per word; pluggable AI detectors for
  power users (off by default).
- **Fast** — pure Rust, no WebView, no perceptible typing latency.
- **Light** — single binary, ~10–15 MB.
- **Quiet** — tray-only, minimal CPU/RAM, **zero telemetry**. Exactly
  one network call exists — the update check (§ [Staying up to
  date](#staying-up-to-date)) — it sends nothing about you, and one
  checkbox turns it off. The AI subsystem is off by default and needs
  a second explicit toggle to reach the network at all.
- **Configurable** — autostart, per-language allowlist, per-app
  exceptions, hotkeys, sound themes.
- **Open source** — MIT licensed.

## Platforms

| OS              | Status                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10 / 11 | working                                                                                                                                                                       |
| macOS 11+       | working — validated on macOS 15 (Intel); needs Accessibility **and** Input Monitoring permission (the app prompts on first launch)                                  |
| Linux (Wayland) | working; run `scripts/setup-linux.sh` once (evdev + uinput access). Layout switching: Hyprland, KDE Plasma, GSettings (GNOME / Ubuntu Unity / Cinnamon / Budgie / Pantheon / MATE), IBus, Fcitx5. |
| Linux (X11)     | working, and needs **no setup script at all** — XInput2 listener + XTest emitter need no `input`-group membership. Layout switching via the DE backends above, falling back to XKB group locking on bare WMs (i3, openbox, …). |

permissions story.

## Install

Builds are published as GitHub Releases —
[**Releases page**](../../releases). Each release ships three
installers (plus `latest.json`, the manifest the in-app updater
polls — you never download that one by hand):

| OS                                | File                                          | How to install                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 10 / 11                   | `poltertype-<ver>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.msi` | Double-click. Per-user install — no admin rights, no UAC prompt. SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" → **More info** → **Run anyway**.                                                                 |
| macOS 11+ (Intel + Apple Silicon) | `poltertype-<ver>-universal-apple-darwin.dmg` | Open the DMG, drag `poltertype.app` into `/Applications`. First launch: right-click the app → **Open** (or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/poltertype.app`). Then grant Accessibility permission. |
| Linux (x86_64)                    | `poltertype-<ver>-x86_64.AppImage`            | `chmod +x` and run. Per-user, no system install. See [docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) for evdev access on Wayland.                                                                                        |

> Installers are still **unsigned** — that's why Gatekeeper /
> SmartScreen warn on first launch. Code signing comes in a later
> phase.

Building from source is documented in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Staying up to date

You only have to do the above once. From then on PolterType keeps
itself current — **this is on by default.** It checks GitHub for new
releases once a day (first check ~a minute after startup), downloads
the installer for your platform in the background, verifies its
SHA-256 against the release manifest, and then **waits**. Nothing is
installed while you are typing — the swap happens when you quit the
app, or when you click **⟳ Restart to update** in the tray menu.

This is the **only** part of PolterType that touches the network. It
is two requests: a `GET` of a small JSON manifest, and — only when
there's actually a new version — a `GET` of the installer itself. No
account, no identifier, nothing about you and nothing about what you
type. What GitHub can see is what any download reveals: your IP, and
a User-Agent naming the running version (`PolterType/0.6.1
(updater)`). The exact manifest URL is printed on the Settings
window's **General** pane, so you never have to take our word for it.

Turn it off with the checkbox on that same pane, or in `config.toml`:

```toml
[updates]
enabled              = true    # ← the default. false = never check, never download
check_interval_hours = 24      # floor is 1; 0 does NOT mean "off", it means hourly
```

Switching it off also deletes anything already downloaded. To never
have the code in the first place, build from source — but note the
updater is a normal (non-optional) part of the default build.

Three caveats worth stating plainly:

- **The download is checksum-verified, not signed.** The checksum
  comes from the same GitHub release as the installer, so it catches a
  corrupted download or a tampered CDN — but not a compromised GitHub
  account. Signing the manifest is planned (see
  [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md)).
- **Only our own installers self-update.** If you installed from a
  distro package, or you're running a `cargo build` binary, PolterType
  won't overwrite it — those files aren't ours. You'll get a
  notification pointing at the Releases page instead. The same applies
  if you're not on x86_64 (or an Apple Silicon Mac): we don't publish
  an artifact for you, so there's nothing to update to.
- **The macOS path is unproven.** The Windows and Linux self-update
  paths are exercised; the `.app`-bundle swap is written from Apple's
  docs and has never run on real hardware. Treat macOS self-updating
  as untested rather than broken — and see
  [docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) before relying on it.

## Stack

- Pure Rust — no WebView, no Node.
- `tao` event loop + `tray-icon` + `global-hotkey` + `single-instance`.
- `ureq` + `rustls` + `sha2` for the updater — the app's only network
  code, and the only reason a TLS stack is linked in at all.
- Optional AI subsystem (`feature = "ai"`) — local ONNX or remote LLM
  detectors / word rewriters. Off by default, and **not wired to the
  engine yet**: the crate ships stubs that nothing constructs, so no
  build makes an AI-related network call regardless of the flags.
  (The updater is separate, and does go to the network — see above.)
  See [docs/AI.md](docs/AI.md).

See [docs/PLAN.md §2](docs/PLAN.md) for the alternatives considered.

## Hotkeys

Two built-in hotkeys, both rebindable on the **Hotkeys** pane of
the Settings window:

| Default                | Action                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Space`     | Pause / resume auto-switching.                                                                    |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` | Force-switch the most recent word — ignores every filter, including the dev-friendly skips below. |

> **On Wayland the force-switch default is `Ctrl+Shift+F9`, not
> `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`.** There we read keys from the evdev
> keystream, which means the chord also reaches the focused app — and
> `Ctrl+Backspace` deletes the very word you asked to fix. So if you
> leave the binding at its default, PolterType silently substitutes a
> key that no app acts on. Bind it explicitly and your choice wins,
> destructive or not.

## Spelling suggestions

Wrong-layout words get auto-corrected; plain typos get *suggested*.
When a word you just finished isn't in the dictionary for the
language you're typing, a small tooltip appears near the focused
window with up to 5 nearby dictionary words — click one, or press
`Ctrl+Shift+<digit>`, and the word is replaced in place. When the
engine saw a possible wrong-layout word but wasn't confident enough
to auto-switch, that candidate leads the list with a layout badge, so
the borderline cases become your one-click call.

Everything is local: candidates come from the bundled dictionaries
(plus your own wordlist overlays), ranked by a keyboard-aware edit
distance that knows `hwllo` is a slipped finger away from `hello`.
The last row of every tooltip is **Add to dictionary** — one click
teaches PolterType your jargon, names and project vocabulary for
good. The tooltip never steals keyboard focus and disappears after
30 seconds or the moment you type past it. Tune or disable it on the
**Suggestions** pane (`[suggestions]` in `config.toml`).

> The tooltip currently renders on **Hyprland/Sway (Wayland
> layer-shell) and X11**. GNOME/KDE Wayland, macOS and Windows don't
> have an overlay backend yet; there the feature stays engine-side
> only.
>
> Where it lands depends on what the focused app will tell us. Apps
> with a live accessibility bridge report the caret, and the tooltip
> sits directly above it; everything else gets it just above the
> window's bottom edge — the neighbourhood of chat boxes and shell
> prompts. It is never placed by your mouse pointer.

## Smart commands (text triggers)

On top of the two built-in hotkeys, you can define `[[commands]]`
entries — short typed tokens that expand or trigger an action when
the engine sees them at a word boundary. The shape mirrors classic
text expanders (TextExpander, Espanso, AutoHotkey hotstrings):

```toml
[[commands]]
id      = "anrl"
trigger = "anrl"
action  = { type = "type_text", text = "Anatomical Reference List" }

[[commands]]
id      = "to-english"
trigger = "((en))"
action  = { type = "switch_layout", layout = "en-US" }

[[commands]]
id      = "open-config"
trigger = ";cfg"
action  = { type = "open_path", path = "C:/Users/me/AppData/Roaming/poltertype/config.toml" }
apps    = ["Code.exe"]
```

Three v1 actions: `type_text` (snippet expansion), `switch_layout`
(BCP-47 id), `open_path` (file or URL). Optional `apps = [...]`
scopes a command to specific foreground apps using the same
basename match `[exceptions].disabled_apps` already uses. Manage
them on the **Commands** pane in Settings.

## Dev-friendly: stays out of code

If you write code, you _don't_ want a layout switcher meddling with
identifiers. Two guards protect you, and they are pure engine logic —
they work in every app, on every OS:

- **Per-token identifier guard** — the engine doesn't auto-switch on
  tokens that look like identifiers: `snake_case`, `camelCase`,
  `letter+digit`, or anything containing `\\` / `;` / `` ` ``. Toggle
  via `engine.suppress_in_identifiers = false` in `config.toml`.
- **Plausibility-keep** — if the word you typed already reads as
  plausible for the current layout (real letters, sane vowel ratio,
  no ridiculous consonant pile-ups), the engine refuses to switch
  even if the alternate scores higher. This is what keeps `kubectl`,
  `terraform`, `nginx`, surnames, and other "real but uncommon"
  vocabulary from getting auto-corrected to Cyrillic noise.

If that isn't enough for a particular app, silence it there
explicitly:

- **Per-app skip list** — `[exceptions].disabled_apps` in
  `config.toml`, matched case-insensitively against the focused
  process's executable basename (`Code.exe`, `code`, `kitty`, …).
  **Empty by default**: PolterType corrects everywhere until you tell
  it not to. We used to ship a long list of editors and terminals
  here, and the result was an app that appeared dead in exactly the
  windows developers type in. Add the entries you want, or manage
  them on the **Exceptions** pane in Settings.

> **The skip list needs a focus tracker, and one doesn't exist
> everywhere.** Reading which application has focus is implemented on
> Windows, Hyprland and X11. On macOS and on non-Hyprland Wayland
> (GNOME/KDE) the tracker is a no-op, so the per-app skip list, the
> per-app wordlist profiles below, and the `apps = [...]` scoping on
> smart commands silently do nothing there.

### Adding your own vocabulary

For specialty words the engine doesn't know yet (project-specific
terms, slang, brand names), the easiest path is the **Wordlists**
pane in the Settings window — pick a layout, type words one per
line, hit Save.

The same files live under `<config-dir>/poltertype/wordlists/`
if you'd rather edit them by hand (the Wordlists pane writes to
exactly these locations). The stem is the BCP-47 id with `-`
replaced by `_` (e.g. `en-US` → `en_us.txt`):

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\opensource\poltertype\config\wordlists\en_us.txt`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.opensource.poltertype/wordlists/en_us.txt`
- Linux: `~/.config/poltertype/wordlists/en_us.txt`

One lowercase word per line; blank lines and `#`-comments ignored.
Adding to the bundled `data/wordlists/*.txt` files in the repo,
on the other hand, requires rebuilding the binary (those bake
into the FST at compile time).

**Per-app profiles** — if `kubectl` should count as a real word
inside VS Code but not in chat, declare a `[[wordlists.profiles]]`
entry in `config.toml` and drop the per-profile overlays under
`<config-dir>/poltertype/wordlists/profiles/<id>/<stem>.txt`.
The engine swaps the active overlay set when the focused app
changes. See [docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md](docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md) for the
full schema.

Wordlist edits apply **without a restart**: closing the Settings
window rebuilds the dictionaries automatically, and "Reload
Settings" in the tray does the same for hand-edited files. (Only
the *bundled* `data/wordlists/*.txt` need a rebuild — those bake
into the FST at compile time.)

Writing a comment in another language inside an IDE? Hit
`Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` after the word — that hotkey ignores every
filter by design. (On Wayland: `Ctrl+Shift+F9`, see above.)

## Settings

Two ways to configure:

1. **Tray → "Settings…"** opens a real GUI (`iced 0.13` with the
   lightweight `tiny-skia` renderer). Seven panes: **Languages**,
   **Hotkeys**, **Commands** (text-trigger snippet expanders),
   **Wordlists** (per-layout user-overlay editor with optional
   per-app profile picker), **General**, **Exceptions**, **About**.
2. **Tray → "Edit config.toml…"** opens the raw TOML file in your
   default editor — useful for things the GUI doesn't expose yet
   (creating a new wordlist profile entry, listing
   `[[commands]]` in bulk, …):
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\opensource\poltertype\config\config.toml`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/dev.opensource.poltertype/config.toml`
   - Linux: `~/.config/poltertype/config.toml`

Logs land under the OS data dir; "Open Logs Folder…" in the tray
takes you there. After editing the TOML, "Reload Settings" picks
up the change — general flags, exceptions, hotkey bindings, and
wordlist / profile overlays alike — without a restart. Closing the
Settings window does the same thing on its way out, so anything you
changed in the GUI is already live by the time the window is gone.

The tray also carries **Pause auto-switch**, **Open User Wordlists
Folder…**, **Open User Layouts Folder…**, and — unless you turned
updates off — **Check for updates…**, which becomes **⟳ Restart to
update** once a new version is staged. If the keyboard hooks fail to
start, a **⚠ Setup Guide…** entry appears at the top pointing at
[docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md).

The GUI runs as a child process (`poltertype --settings`) so
the tray's `tao::EventLoop` and iced's `winit` event loop don't
fight over the macOS main thread. Crashes in the UI never bring
down the engine; see [DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the
full rationale.
