# Decision log

Short-form record of non-obvious technical choices made while
implementing PolterType. Each entry: **what** was decided, **why**,
and any **alternatives** considered.

## 2026-07-29 — A `poltertype-tray` crate, for one function

Building the tray makes `libayatana-appindicator` print a deprecation
notice to stderr on every start — addressed to whoever links it, which
is `tray-icon`, not us. There is no lever on our side: the sys crate
`dlopen`s `libayatana-appindicator3.so.1` by name, its `backcompat`
feature only adds unversioned-`.so` fallbacks, and `tray-icon` 0.24 —
five versions ahead of the one we pin — still loads the same object.

**Redirected, not silenced.** A GLib log handler on that one domain
hands the text to `tracing` at debug level. The message stays reachable
the day the library actually disappears (which would break the tray),
without sitting in the journal of every Linux user. Every other GLib
domain keeps GLib's default handler.

**Why a whole crate for fifteen lines.** `poltertype-app` contains no
`#[cfg(target_os = "...")]` at all — platform code lives in dedicated
crates, and that rule is worth more than the crate it costs. The
alternatives were to put the first `#[cfg]` in the binary and amend the
rule, or to hide a GTK concern inside an unrelated platform crate. So
`poltertype-tray` exists, holding per-OS tray quirks; the `TrayIcon`
itself is still built in the app, because `tray-icon` already
abstracts it. The list in `CLAUDE.md` is now five crates, not four.

**`cargo deny` gained an entry on the way.** RUSTSEC-2024-0429 (glib
0.18's unsound `VariantStrIter`) fails the advisory check — it already
did before this change, since `tray-icon` and `tao` have pulled glib
into the lockfile all along; the advisory is simply newer than the last
release. The fix is glib >=0.20, which needs gtk-rs 0.20, which needs a
`tray-icon` that has left GTK3 — the same wait as the nine GTK3 entries
above it. Nothing here calls the affected API.

## 2026-07-29 — The tooltip anchors to the caret or the window, never the mouse

The suggestion tooltip's anchor chain had the pointer position sitting
between the AT-SPI caret and the focused window, justified as "after a
click into the text the pointer hovers near the caret". That premise
holds for about a second. Nothing in the chain could tell a pointer
resting where the user last clicked from one parked in the middle of
the screen while they typed, and the second case is the common one —
you click into a chat box, take your hand back to the keyboard, and the
mouse stays wherever it was. Reported against a chat input at the very
bottom of a display, with the tooltip appearing in the centre of it;
reproduced with the caret 600 px below the pointer, the tooltip landing
on the pointer every time.

**Removed rather than repaired.** The honest fix would need to know
when the pointer was last moved *and* that it was moved into text,
which neither Hyprland's `cursorpos` nor X11's `QueryPointer` can say
and which no amount of click-tracking recovers once the pointer drifts.
Without a caret the tooltip now falls to the window rect — bottom-centre,
`BOTTOM_OFFSET` above the window's bottom edge. That is coarse for a
caret in the middle of a code editor, and right for the chat inputs and
shell prompts that dominate this feature; more to the point it is always
in the focused window, which the pointer anchor could not promise. The
`FocusTracker::pointer_position` method and its three backends went with
it.

**A second bug hid behind the first.** The Wayland popup thread blocks
on its command channel while no popup is up, so it reads nothing from
the compositor between shows. `OutputState`'s replies — the output
names, logical sizes and scales that every placement depends on — had
not arrived when the *first* popup of a session was built: it got
`bounds: None` (no edge clamping at all) and `output: None` on the layer
surface, which hands the compositor the choice of monitor while the
margins were computed against a different one's origin. The second popup
onwards worked, because the tick loop had pumped the queue by then,
which is exactly why it looked intermittent. The thread now round-trips
the queue before serving a `Show` — one round-trip on a thread that has
nothing else to do, and it picks up hotplugs and mode changes that
happened while parked as a bonus.

Verified live on a four-output Hyprland session, including a
`transform: 3` rotated output (logical bounds correctly `1440×2560`) and
a fractional-scale one (`2048×1280` at scale 2).

## 2026-07-29 — Hold keystrokes back with `EVIOCGRAB` during a correction

A correction is a burst of injected keys, and the compositor
interleaves whatever the user types into it. Counting after the fact
cannot place a key that landed *inside* our own text (`зтзь ш ` came
out as `ipnpm `), so the fix is to stop the user's keys from reaching
applications until the burst has landed — `EVIOCGRAB`, the evdev
equivalent of a Windows low-level hook swallowing events. We keep
reading the grabbed devices, so the engine still sees every keystroke
and types them out behind the correction, in order
(`poltertype-input::KeyGate`).

Measured on Hyprland + keyd (uinput injection at fixed inter-key gaps,
result read back through the clipboard). Typing a whole command
straight through — `зтзь ш кгт `, 90–190 ms gaps:

| | wrong |
|---|---|
| absorb + repair only | 4 of 6 |
| first working gate | 6 of 6 (worse: characters *missing*) |
| gate, after the three fixes below | **0 of 6** |

The gate only became a win once three things were fixed, none of them
in the gate's own logic — each was found by measuring rather than
reasoning:

1. **The 2 s device rescan blocked the read loop for 70–140 ms.**
   `evdev::enumerate()` opens every node under `/dev/input` and reads
   its capabilities; doing that on the thread that reads key events
   left the engine blind for ~5 % of wall-clock time, events arriving
   late and in bursts. It now reads the directory and opens only
   genuinely new paths — and remembers the verdict per path, since most
   nodes are sound cards that will never be keyboards. (A win with or
   without the gate.)
2. **Releasing a device costs 13–25 ms.** The gate grabbed every open
   device — mice, lid switch, idle HID endpoints — so a correction
   spent ~100 ms in `EVIOCGRAB(0)` inside the very thread that has to
   notice the user typing. It now holds only keyboards, and only ones
   used in the last 30 s: in practice one device.
3. **A grab that outlived its correction was catastrophic.** The next
   correction then counted held keystrokes as though they were on
   screen and deleted text that was never there — a whole word gone,
   far worse than a transposition. `release()` waits for the device
   thread to confirm (250 ms, which costs the user nothing since their
   text is already on screen), and `hold()` refuses to start on top of
   a stale grab.

Safety: the device thread owns the grab and drops it after
[`MAX_HOLD`] (1.2 s) whatever the engine does, so a hung or panicking
correction cannot leave the keyboard dead; a crashed process is safe by
construction, as the kernel releases on close. Held keys are never
silently eaten — Backspace, arrows and Esc are re-emitted after our
text, which is where they would have landed anyway. Shortcuts are the
one gap: they need modifiers the emitter cannot reproduce, so the gate
lets go immediately instead.

**Behind an input remapper the gate cannot run, and knows it.** keyd
holds every physical keyboard *and our own uinput device* exclusively
and re-emits through one virtual keyboard, so the only grabbable source
of the user's keys also carries ours — grabbing it silently gags the
correction itself (verified: injection from a keyd-claimed device under
that grab produces nothing at all). The probe is exact and cheap: if we
can grab our own emitter, nobody is proxying it. Those users keep the
detect-and-repair path, and `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` documents the keyd
one-liner that gets them the gate.

Also worth recording, since it looked like an answer for a while: keyd
claims a uinput device by the *breadth of keys it declares*, not by
name or vendor. Declaring only what the emitter can actually type (51
keys) is still claimed; only an implausibly small keyboard escapes.
Masquerading under keyd's own vendor id works but is a lie about what
the device is, so it is not shipped.

## 2026-05-02 — Use Win SC Set-1 scancodes as the canonical key identity

The engine indexes layout-mapping tables by *scancode*, not by
*virtual-key code*. Reasons:

* Scancode is stable across layouts (the physical key labelled "Q"
  is always `0x10`); VK changes per layout (Q under en-US is `'Q'`,
  under uk-UA it's `'Й'`).
* On Windows we already get the scancode for free in
  `KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT.scanCode`. macOS provides keycode; Linux evdev
  provides EV_KEY codes — both will be normalised into the same Set-1
  space in their respective backend modules.

## 2026-05-02 — Layout mappings embedded via `include_str!`

> **SUPERSEDED** by the 2026-05-07 externalisation entry below.
> Nothing is baked into the binary any more: mappings and wordlists
> are read from `<data_dir>/` at run time, and user overrides live in
> `<config-dir>/poltertype/layouts/` (note: `layouts/`, not
> `layout-mappings/`). They shipped in v0.1, not "Phase 8+".

For v0.1 the EN/UK mapping TOMLs live in `data/layout-mappings/` and
are baked into the binary at compile time. Runtime overrides from
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/poltertype/layout-mappings/` are a Phase 8+ task.

Reason: avoids a "where's my data dir?" failure mode on first launch
and keeps the binary self-contained for distribution.

## 2026-05-02 — Use `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` for text replay (Windows)

When the corrector replays text in the new layout, we use
`SendInput` with `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` and the codepoint instead of
synthesising scancode + VK presses. Reason: it works regardless of
the currently active layout and bypasses layout-induced corner cases
(dead keys, non-spacing marks). The cost — apps that handle raw
key events specially (e.g. games) will see the synthetic events as
"some text was pasted" rather than "user typed this". Acceptable for
v0.1 since we're explicitly out of scope for games (per-app exception
list handles those).

## 2026-05-02 — Word-buffer classifies by produced character, not raw scancode

Earlier the `WordBuffer` mapped scancodes to "letter / boundary /
backspace / discard" via a hard-coded table that **assumed US-ANSI
positions**. That works for en-US but is silently wrong for any
non-Latin layout: scancode `0x33` is `,` under en-US (a sentence
boundary) but the letter `б` under uk-UA (a word character).

Concrete bug it produced: a Ukrainian user typing `будь ` was
parsed as a wholly empty boundary (the `б` reset the word-in-progress
to nothing), then a 3-letter word `удь` (uk render) ↔ `elm` (en
render). `елm` is a real EN dictionary word, so the engine
"helpfully" auto-switched and replayed `елm `. Same shape applies to
0x34 (en `.` → uk `ю`), 0x29 backtick under any Cyrillic layout, etc.

The fix: `WordBuffer::feed` now takes the character the layout
actually produced (`Option<char>`); the engine queries
`current_layout.translate_key(...)` per-keystroke and threads the
result through. Classification is in two layers:

1. **Control / structural keys** (Esc, Backspace, Tab, Enter,
   Space, modifiers, function row, navigation cluster) — keyed by
   scancode alone, layout-independent. Fast path.
2. **Data keys** — keyed by the produced character class:
   * `is_alphabetic` / digit / `'` `ʼ` `'` / `-` → word
   * everything else → boundary

Cost: one extra Win32 call per keystroke (`GetForegroundWindow` →
`GetWindowThreadProcessId` → `GetKeyboardLayout`). Microseconds.
Worth it for correctness.

Regression locked in by `classifies_by_produced_char_not_scancode`
in `poltertype-core::engine::buffer::tests`.

## 2026-05-02 — Plausibility-keep + runtime-reloadable user overlay

Two related fixes from real-world testing:

### 1. `keep_threshold` on the plausibility detector

User report: `kubectl` (a perfectly normal en-US word for any DevOps
person) was getting auto-switched to `лгиусед` (the Cyrillic render
of the same scancodes). Trace: `kubectl` isn't in the
`dwyl/english-words` FST (general English dict, no tech vocab), so
the dictionary detector returned NoOpinion. Plausibility then scored
`kubectl` at 0.75 (good) vs `лгиусед` at 1.0 (also good — comparable
vowel ratio, no consonant pile-up under uk-UA). Diff 0.25 ≥ the
`min_advantage` threshold → switch.

Fix: `WordPlausibilityDetector` now has a `keep_threshold = 0.7`. If
the current text already scores at this level for its own layout,
the detector emits `Verdict::Keep` instead of looking at alternates.
That's the right semantics — "current is already plausibly its own
language, leave it alone."

This catches the whole class: surnames, brand names, modern tech
vocabulary (kubectl, helm, terraform, docker, nginx), single-token
abbreviations, Cyrillic forms not in the Hunspell stems file, etc.
The Punto cases (real cross-script gibberish like `руддщ` ↔ `hello`)
still switch correctly because gibberish scores well below 0.7.

### 2. Runtime-reloadable user wordlist overlay

The original "Reload Settings" only re-read `config.toml`. The
embedded dictionaries (FST + short-stop) are baked at compile time
and can't be reloaded — but the user-overlay files at
`<config-dir>/poltertype/wordlists/<stem>.txt` SHOULD be reloadable
so users can add tech vocab without restarting.

Implementation: `DictionaryDetector` now holds its dicts behind
`Arc<RwLock<HashMap<…>>>` so they can be swapped atomically. The app
keeps a cheap clone (`detector.handle()`) and on "Reload Settings"
calls `LayoutDb::load_embedded_with_user_overlay(...)` to re-read
the user files, then `handle.replace_dicts(new)` to swap in.

Read locks are taken per-word during decision; write only on reload.
Lock contention is negligible.

## 2026-05-02 — Real Hunspell-grade dictionaries via FST

The hand-curated ~280-word lists shipped earlier worked for the
common case but missed long-tail vocabulary. Switched to:

* **EN**: [`dwyl/english-words`](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
  `words_alpha.txt` — Public Domain — ~370k entries.
* **UK**: [LibreOffice/dictionaries](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries)
  `uk_UA/uk_UA.dic` — MPL 1.1 — ~333k entries (derived from
  brown-uk/dict_uk).

Storage: not `HashSet<String>` (too much heap overhead at this
scale). [BurntSushi `fst` crate](https://docs.rs/fst) compresses the
sorted, deduped wordlist into an immutable byte-buffer set. At
build time `poltertype-core/build.rs` reads `data/wordlists/<id>.txt` and
emits `<OUT_DIR>/<stem>.fst`. At runtime we `include_bytes!` the
blob and wrap in `fst::Set::new(&'static [u8])` — O(len) lookup,
no per-word allocation, lives in `.rodata`.

Concrete cost: release binary 5 → 6.85 MB (+1.85 MB for both FSTs);
~3 MB additional resident memory at runtime. 700k+ words for
~5 bytes per word storage cost — FST is the right tool.

> **PARTLY SUPERSEDED** by the 2026-05-07 externalisation entry.
> The FST choice stands; the plumbing around it changed. Today
> `build.rs` reads `data/wordlists/<stem>.txt.gz` and writes the FST
> into `<workspace>/target/dist/data/wordlists/`, and the runtime
> reads it from disk — there is no `include_bytes!` and nothing in
> `.rodata`, so the binary-size figures above no longer apply.

User overlay path: drop a one-word-per-line text file at
`<config-dir>/poltertype/wordlists/<stem>.txt` to extend a
dictionary with project-specific vocabulary (proper nouns, slang,
domain terms). The overlay is loaded at startup and merged on top
of the embedded FST.

`xtask wordlists fetch` re-downloads upstream sources, runs the
Hunspell-format normalisation (strip `/affixflags`, drop `+cs=`
metadata, lowercase, dedupe, sort), and writes the cleaned txt
files for review and commit.

## 2026-05-02 — Detection in v0.1 = vowel/consonant plausibility

A pure script detector can't separate "real word in this layout" from
"keyboard noise that uses this script" (e.g. `руддщ` is fully Cyrillic
yet gibberish in Ukrainian). For v0.1 we ship `WordPlausibilityDetector`
which scores each candidate text by:

* **vowel ratio** in [0.25, 0.55] — real words land here in both EN
  and UK; pure noise rarely does.
* **max consonant cluster** ≤ 3 — `ддщ` (3 consecutive consonants
  with no separating vowel) is a strong negative signal.
* **script fit** — guards against accidental cross-script chars
  (paste, IME).

The vowel sets are language-specific (Cyrillic UK ≠ Cyrillic RU), so
the detector loads them per `LayoutId` from the layout-mapping TOMLs.

Real n-gram / dictionary / ML detectors land in Phase 7 (the AI
subsystem). Until then we lean on the manual hotkey
`Ctrl+Shift+Backspace` ("fix this word") as the always-works fallback.

> **PARTLY SUPERSEDED.** The `DictionaryDetector` did not wait for
> Phase 7 — it shipped in v0.1 as an FST over Hunspell-expanded
> wordlists, and it is now the highest-priority detector. Only the ML
> ones are still outstanding (and the AI crate remains unwired — see
> `AI.md`). No n-gram model was ever built; `lingua-rs` was dropped.

## 2026-05-02 — Settings format: TOML

Rationale in PLAN.md §3.5 — human-readable and editable, plays nicely
with `serde`. JSON was the initial idea; we picked TOML once we
dropped Tauri (which gave us the `tauri-plugin-store` JSON workflow
for free).

## 2026-05-02 — `injected = true` events are dropped before reaching the engine

The Corrector itself synthesises keystrokes via `SendInput`; those
events come back through the LL hook with `LLKHF_INJECTED` set. The
engine must ignore them to avoid feedback loops where a correction
triggers another correction.

## 2026-05-02 — Dev-friendly behaviour: skip auto-switch in IDEs and on identifiers

The product target audience includes developers, and they specifically
need the corrector to **stay out of code**. Switching layouts mid-
identifier would actively harm the user; the cost of a missed prose
correction inside an IDE is much lower than the cost of corrupting
a function name.

The trade-off in v0.1 is two complementary filters, both
opt-out-able via `config.toml`:

* **Per-app**: `[exceptions].disabled_apps`. The focus tracker
  (`poltertype-input::focus`) reads the foreground process executable
  and the engine matches case-insensitively. Match → skip
  auto-decision. **The list is empty by default** — see "Reversed: no
  default app skip-list" below.
* **Per-token**: even outside the IDE list, the engine checks
  `looks_like_code_token(buffer)` from `poltertype-detect`. If the just-
  finished token contains an underscore, has a mid-token capital
  (camelCase / PascalCase), mixes letters and digits, or carries
  code punctuation (`\\`, `;`, `` ` ``) — skip. This catches
  identifiers in chat / browser / wiki / wherever.
  Acronyms (`URL`, `HTML`) and ordinary capitalised prose
  (`Hello`, `Привіт`) deliberately do NOT trip the heuristic.

The **manual** switch hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`) bypasses both
filters. That's the explicit user-asked-for-it path: when you actually
do want to fix a wrong-layout identifier or a comment line, hit the
hotkey and the engine acts unconditionally.

What this does not (yet) do: distinguish "code" vs "comment" inside
the same editor. That requires per-IDE integration — out of scope for
v0.1. Until then, dev users hit the hotkey when writing comments in
a non-default language.

The forward-compat side: every settings struct now carries
`#[serde(default)]`, so future versions adding new fields read
existing user configs without scary parse errors.

## 2026-05-02 — Phase 4: deferred full GUI; settings = open `config.toml` in editor

PLAN.md §10 originally pencilled `iced` settings pages for Phase 4.
On reflection:

* `iced` (or `egui`) integrated with `tao` + `tray-icon` +
  `global-hotkey` requires careful event-loop juggling, especially
  on macOS where only one runtime can own the main thread.
* The most-used flows (toggle autostart, pick active languages, set
  hotkeys) are perfectly serviceable via direct TOML editing —
  Karabiner-Elements, Alfred and many other tray apps work this way.
* Building the GUI now would lock in choices that may need redoing
  once we know how macOS / Wayland event loops play with iced.

So Phase 4 ships:

* "Open Settings" tray item opens `config.toml` in the user's default
  editor via the cross-platform `opener` crate.
* "Open Logs" tray item opens the log directory.
* "Reload Settings" re-reads `config.toml` and notifies the engine.
* File-backed logging via `tracing-appender` (rotates daily).
* Engine respects `[languages].active` to scope candidate layouts.

Full visual settings UI (iced or egui) is deferred to Phase 8 / v0.2,
when we already know how macOS / Linux event loops behave from
Phases 5 / 6.

> **SUPERSEDED** — see the later 2026-05-07 entry on the settings
> window. The iced GUI shipped during 0.1.0-beta, well ahead of this
> plan, and now has seven panes. It runs as a `--settings` child
> process, which is what defused the macOS main-thread concern that
> motivated the deferral.


## 2026-05-07 — Hunspell stems gap + plateau widening (multi-layout regression)

### The bug

A user typing `має` (Ukrainian for "has") under uk-UA reported the
word being silently deleted. Tracing the pipeline:

1. Buffer captured scancodes `0x2F 0x21 0x28` (the keys `M`, `A`,
   `'` on a US-physical keyboard).
2. Renders, by layout: `vf'` (en-US), `має` (uk-UA), `маэ` (ru-RU),
   **`vfä`** (de-DE), `vf´` (es-ES), `vfù` (fr-FR).
3. `DictionaryDetector` ran first — `має` is **not** in the embedded
   uk-UA FST (next paragraph) — and returned `NoOpinion` because the
   alt renderings also miss the dictionaries.
4. `WordPlausibilityDetector`:
   * `має` (uk-UA) — vowel-ratio = 2/3 = **0.667**, just outside the
     plateau `0.25..=0.55` → `vowel_fit = 0.325`, **`fit = 0.66`**.
     Below the `keep_threshold = 0.7` → no Keep.
   * `vfä` (de-DE) — vowel-ratio = 1/3 = 0.333, *inside* plateau →
     `vowel_fit = 1.0`, `fit = 1.0`. Best alt.
   * Advantage `1.0 − 0.66 = 0.34 ≥ min_advantage 0.25` → **Switch
     to de-DE**.
5. The corrector backspaced `має ` and re-emitted `vfä `. Visually
   the user saw their Ukrainian word vanish under a layout switch.

The regression was introduced when the de-DE / fr-FR layouts joined
the candidate set — with only en-US ↔ uk-UA, the EN render `vf'`
has no Latin vowels and scores ≈ 0.5, never beating `має`'s 0.66 by
the required advantage.

### Why `має` isn't in the FST

The LibreOffice `uk_UA.dic` Hunspell file ships **stems only** —
`мати`, `робити`, `знати` — and expects an `.aff` rules file to
expand them at runtime into the actual inflected forms (`має`,
`робить`, `знає`, …). Our `cargo xtask wordlists fetch` pipeline
processes the `.dic` *without* applying the affix rules, so the
~600+ inflected forms of common verbs are missing from the FST.

A proper Hunspell-aware expander would solve this categorically.
The fix landed in three stages:

### Fix A — extras list (data, the immediate plug)

`data/wordlists/uk_ua-extras.txt` initially shipped the present /
past / future forms of the ~30 highest-frequency Ukrainian verbs
(167 entries). Generated locally by cross-checking against the FST
and keeping only the missing forms. Once Fix C below was in place,
all 167 entries were redundant and the file is back to its
original "escape hatch for genuine gaps" content — but the data
fix is documented here because it's the right reach when a future
gap surfaces and the expander hasn't caught up yet.

### Fix B — plateau widening (algorithm)

`WordPlausibilityDetector::fit` now uses a `0.25..=0.67` plateau
(was `0.25..=0.55`). The wider band catches V-C-V short words like
`має` / `оса` / `eye` / `our` (vowel-ratio = 0.667) which read as
perfectly normal language but missed the old plateau by a hair.
The decay formula's centre shifted from 0.4 to 0.46 (midpoint of
the new range) to keep the off-plateau slope symmetric.

Verified: `руддщ` (gibberish, vowel-ratio = 0.2) still scores 0.42
— below `keep_threshold` — so the symmetric "user typed Cyrillic
but uk-UA was the *active* layout for what was meant to be EN
prose" auto-switch still fires correctly.

### Fix C — Hunspell affix expander (long-term, structural)

`xtask/src/hunspell.rs` implements a small Hunspell `.aff` parser +
`.dic` expander that reads each stem's flag string and produces
all surface forms via the rules. The xtask `wordlists fetch`
command was rewritten to download both `.dic` AND `.aff` from
LibreOffice/dictionaries (we already had `.dic`) and run the
expansion at fetch time rather than just stripping affix flags.

Coverage results (per `cargo xtask wordlists fetch` log):

| Lang | Stems  | Surface forms | Multiplier |
|------|-------:|--------------:|-----------:|
| uk   | 350656 | 3 486 848     |  9.9 ×     |
| ru   | 146269 | 1 436 553     |  9.8 ×     |
| de   | 258202 |   789 398     |  3.1 ×     |
| es   |  58221 |   652 463     | 11.2 ×     |
| fr   |  84139 | 2 139 550     | 25.4 ×     |

The expander is a deliberately *lossy* port — it skips compound-
word generation, PFX × SFX cross-products, and the `ICONV` /
`OCONV` machinery (the latter only matters for spell-check input
normalisation, not vocabulary). The file's module doc-comment
spells out exactly what's in and out of scope so the next person
to extend it knows where to look.

Encoding handling: most modern dictionaries ship UTF-8, but
`de_DE_frami` is still ISO-8859-1. `read_hunspell_text` tries
UTF-8 first, falls back to scanning for the `SET` directive in the
first 2 KB, and decodes byte-for-byte as Latin-1 if the source says
`ISO8859-*` / `LATIN1` / `WINDOWS-1252`. Adding a new dictionary
in another encoding is a single match arm.

Storage on disk: bulk wordlists ship as `data/wordlists/<id>.txt.gz`
rather than raw `.txt`. Raw, the six languages total ~165 MB
(uk_ua alone is 84 MB after expansion); gzipped they're ~24 MB.
Both `poltertype-core/build.rs` (`flate2::read::GzDecoder`) and the xtask
generator (`flate2::write::GzEncoder`) handle the format
transparently, and the build script falls back to a plain `.txt`
of the same stem if the `.gz` is absent — useful when a contributor
has decompressed one to grep through it. Curated `-extras.txt` and
`-stop.txt` files stay plain text; they're small enough that
compression has zero meaningful impact and editing them in any
text editor needs to keep working.

### Why three layers

Defense in depth. The data fix (A) is what closes a real gap on a
specific build; the algorithm fix (B) is what keeps the engine
honest when *some other* legitimate word also misses the dict;
the structural fix (C) is what removes the gap class altogether
for ~95 % of inflected verb forms going forward.

Regression test lives at `poltertype_detect::tests::plausibility_keeps_short_vcv_cyrillic_word`
and replays the exact 6-layout candidate set the engine produces.
The expander itself has eight unit tests under
`xtask::hunspell::tests` covering the SFX / PFX / class / negclass
/ FLAG-mode / continuation / unknown-directive / FLAG-num-rejection
shapes.


## 2026-05-07 — Data files externalised + lazy-loading by OS-active

Two structural problems with the v0.1 baked-in data approach:

1. **Wasteful RAM** — `include_bytes!` baked all six bundled FSTs
   into `poltertype.exe`. A user with `en-US / uk-UA / ru-RU`
   active in Windows still paid for the fr-FR / de-DE / es-ES FSTs
   sitting resident.
2. **The `http ` bug.** `LayoutDb` exposed every bundled layout to
   the detector regardless of whether the user could actually
   switch to it. fr-FR scored well on `http` (latin script, no
   vowels, all letters legal) and the detector picked it; the
   layout switcher then returned `LayoutError::NotActive` *after*
   `apply_correction` had already sent the backspaces, destroying
   the user's word.

### What changed

* **`crates/poltertype-core/build.rs`** writes layout TOMLs, FSTs, and
  stop-word lists to `<workspace>/target/dist/data/` instead of
  embedding them. The workspace target dir is deduced from
  `OUT_DIR` (walks up to a `target` ancestor), which keeps
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` overrides working.
* **`crates/poltertype-core/src/data_dir.rs`** — new module that resolves
  the data directory at runtime. Order: `POLTERTYPE_DATA_DIR` env
  → `<exe_dir>/data` (Windows MSI, AppImage AppDir) →
  `<exe_dir>/../Resources/data` (macOS .app) →
  `<exe_dir>/../share/poltertype/data` (FHS Linux) →
  `<workspace>/target/dist/data` (dev fallback). Unit-tested
  against synthesised exe paths so the per-platform shape is
  pinned.
* **`LayoutDb::load(LoadOptions { active_filter, … })`** — new
  loader that takes the OS-active layout list and skips bundled
  TOMLs whose `id` isn't in it. Pre-parsing the `id` line via the
  small `peek_layout_id` helper means we don't even read the FST
  for filtered-out languages.
* **`crates/poltertype-app`** queries `LayoutSwitcher::list_active()` at
  startup (right after building the switcher, before loading
  layouts) and feeds the result into `LoadOptions::active_filter`.
  Adding a language in the OS now needs a PolterType restart,
  which is a documented trade — the alternative is OS-event
  plumbing on three platforms for a one-line restart cost.

### Installer changes

Each installer copies the prepared `data/` tree into the
expected runtime location:

* WiX MSI — two new `<Component>` entries (`DataLayoutMappings`,
  `DataWordlists`) under a fresh `<Directory Id="DataDir" Name="data">`
  inside `APPLICATIONROOTFOLDER`. Component GUIDs are fixed (CNDL0230
  forbids `Guid="*"` once a Component holds both Files and a
  RegistryValue keypath, and ICE38 forces the perUser registry
  keypath). `RemoveFolder` directives walk the tree on uninstall.
* macOS DMG — `cp -R ${DATA_DIR} ${APP_DIR}/Contents/Resources/data`,
  matching `<exe_dir>/../Resources/data`.
* Linux AppImage — `mkdir -p ${APPDIR}/usr/share/${APP_NAME}/data &&
  cp -R ${DATA_DIR}/. <there>/`, the FHS layout the resolver looks
  for at rule 4.

### Plug-in foundations

The data layout reserves `<data_dir>/plugins/<pack-id>/` for the
future language-pack marketplace. v1's plug-in surface will be
**data-only** — TOMLs and FSTs, no native code, no network calls,
no settings hooks — to keep the security review small and the
release cycle quick. Full contract documented in `docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md`.

### Settings UI

Added an iced 0.13–based Settings window (`tiny-skia` renderer to
keep build time and binary size tame). Exposed via:

* Tray menu **"Settings…"** entry — spawns
  `poltertype --settings` as a child process. The subprocess form
  side-steps the macOS main-thread fight between `tray-icon` and
  `iced/winit`: each gets its own process and its own NSApplication.
  When the child exits, the tray sends `EngineCommand::SettingsReloaded`
  so changes apply without an explicit "Reload" click.

Three panes for v1:

* **Languages** — checkboxes for every OS-active layout against
  `[languages].active` (allow-list) and `[languages].ignored`
  (veto). Empty allow-list = "use every OS-active layout", which
  is the default and what most users want.
* **General** — autostart, sound on correction, suppress-in-
  identifiers, idle timeout. Plus shortcut buttons to open the
  raw config.toml, logs dir, user-wordlists dir, user-layouts dir.
* **About** — version, repo links, "Reset to defaults" + "Reload
  from disk" power-user escape hatches.

Hotkey rebinding and exception-app management aren't in v1 — both
need richer UI and live config diffing. Power users still edit the
TOML via the **"Edit config.toml…"** tray entry (which the GUI
"Open config.toml" button also exposes).

> **SUPERSEDED** (by a later entry the same day, and by the code).
> The window did not stop at three panes: **Hotkeys** and
> **Exceptions** both became panes of their own, joined later by
> **Commands** and **Wordlists** — seven in total. Don't read the
> three-pane scope above as current.

## 2026-05-07 (later) — Settings UI completion + plug-in loader v1

Three follow-ups landed in the same day as the externalisation:

### 1. Languages pane: render *effective* state, not the raw list

`[languages].active = []` means "every OS layout is considered" (the
default). The earlier UI rendered the raw list, which meant a fresh
install showed zero ticked checkboxes even though every layout was
working. User-reported confusion.

Fix: the Active checkbox now reflects the engine's actual decision
rule (`list.is_empty() || list.contains(id)`), so on first open every
OS-active layout is shown ticked. When the user un-ticks a box from
that implicit-all state, we materialise the allow-list as "every OS
layout *except* this one" — preserving the user's intent across save.

The narrow alternative — auto-populating `[languages].active` with
every OS layout on first save — would have been simpler but breaks
the "use whatever the OS reports today" semantic. Materialising only
on the first un-tick keeps that semantic free for users who never
visit this pane.

### 2. Hotkey rebinding — capture mode + persisted bindings

`crates/poltertype-app/src/main.rs` now reads `[hotkeys]` from settings
(previously hardcoded `Ctrl+Shift+Space` / `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`).
Parser is `global-hotkey`'s native `FromStr`, which accepts the same
`Ctrl+Shift+Space` shape we already document. Bad strings fall back
to the documented default with a warn — same loud-but-graceful
contract as malformed user-layout TOMLs.

Settings UI gains a **Hotkeys** pane with one row per binding +
"Rebind" button. Clicking flips the app into capture mode; an iced
`keyboard::on_key_press` subscription routes the next combo. Rules:

* Lone modifier presses (`Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`, `Meta`) are filtered
  — the user hasn't finished composing yet.
* At least one modifier required — single-letter hotkeys would clash
  with normal typing.
* `Esc` cancels capture without rebinding.

The capture serialiser is unit-tested for round-trip through
`global-hotkey::HotKey::from_str` so the GUI can never produce a
combo that the next tray launch silently drops.

Why a subscription rather than per-widget event hooks: capture is
window-global (the user shouldn't have to focus the "Press a
combination..." field first), and a Subscription lets us toggle
listening on/off via the captured `Option<HotkeyKind>`. Outside
capture mode the subscription is `Subscription::none()`, so the
window doesn't allocate a Message on every keystroke.

### 3. Exceptions pane

Simple list-edit over `[exceptions].disabled_apps`: one row per
entry with a `×` button, plus an Add row at the bottom. Add accepts
both Enter-key and Add-button. Case-insensitive dedup (matches the
engine's runtime comparison via `eq_ignore_ascii_case`).

### 4. Plug-in loader v1

`<data_dir>/plugins/<pack-id>/` is now enumerated at every `LayoutDb`
load. Pack shape (per `docs/DATA_LAYOUT.md`):

```
<pack-dir>/
  manifest.toml          {id, name, version, supported_layouts}
  layout-mappings/*.toml
  wordlists/<stem>.fst   (optional; falls back to plausibility-only)
  wordlists/<stem>-stop.txt  (optional)
```

Precedence: `bundled ← plug-ins ← user-overlay` (last writer wins
on `id` collision). Pack dirs sorted alphabetically for
deterministic load order.

**v1 surface is data-only** — no native code, no network, no
settings injection. The loader function is ~80 LOC, every error
path warns and skips, and four unit tests cover happy-path /
missing-manifest / invalid-manifest / user-override-of-plug-in.
This keeps the security review tractable for the eventual
marketplace launch — when remote downloads + signed packs land,
the existing loader's "data only" assumptions stay sound.

### 5. Wordlists pane

A sixth pane in the Settings window for editing the per-layout
user-overlay text files in `<config-dir>/poltertype/wordlists/`.
Two files per layout, mirroring the loader contract documented in
`crates/poltertype-core/src/layouts/files.rs::build_dictionary`:

* `<stem>.txt` — Extras: full-form words merged into the layout's
  `user_overlay` set.
* `<stem>-stop.txt` — Stop list: short tokens (≤2 letters) merged
  into the layout's `short_stop_words`.

The layout id → stem mapping (`en-US` → `en_us`, `kk-Cyrl-KZ` →
`kk_cyrl_kz`) is the same convention used by the bundled
`data/wordlists/<stem>.fst` filenames and by the loader itself, so
the GUI never writes to a path the engine doesn't read. A unit
test pins this mapping for the canonical 6 bundled layouts plus a
hyphen-rich edge case to catch any future drift.

**Why a separate pane and not inline on Languages**

Languages is a yes / no / ignore decision per layout — checkboxes
fit. Wordlist editing is free-form multiline text — needs a real
editor widget (`iced::widget::text_editor`). Combining the two
would cram a dropdown + editor into every language row and dwarf
the simple toggles users hit most often.

**Why no hot-reload**

The engine loads `<stem>.txt` once at startup via
`LayoutDb::load(...)` and merges it into a `LayoutDictionary`
that's then frozen for the life of the process. Hot-reloading
would mean rebuilding every dictionary on the fly while the engine
might be in the middle of a detector pass — extra synchronisation
for a feature users hit rarely (you tweak your wordlist a couple
times a week, max). The pane shows "Saved to ... Restart
PolterType to apply" so the constraint is visible.

> **SUPERSEDED** (0.1.0-beta.10). Wordlist edits now apply when the
> Settings window closes — a three-step reload rebuilds the config,
> the global wordlists and the per-profile cache. The pane text was
> changed to "Close this window to apply"; a full tray restart is no
> longer required.

**Buffer normalisation**

Saves append a trailing newline if the user didn't type one. The
bundled curated lists all end with `\n`, so this keeps `git diff`
quiet for users who keep their config dir under version control.
Parsing on the engine side (`parse_wordlist`) is identical
whether the file ends with `\n` or not — the normalisation is
purely cosmetic.

**Layout picker UX**

A row of layout buttons (one per OS-active layout) rather than a
`pick_list` dropdown. Two reasons: (1) the typical user has 2-3
layouts, so a row of buttons is faster than opening a dropdown to
pick from a 2-element list; (2) the Languages pane already uses
inline checkboxes, so the visual style stays consistent. If the
OS-active list ever grew large (rare even for polyglots) we'd
revisit, but every UI primitive iced ships works on either shape
of input.

## 2026-05-07 (later still) — Smart commands + per-app wordlist profiles

### 1. Smart commands as text triggers, not hotkeys

The first cut wired user commands as additional global hotkeys via
`GlobalHotKeyManager`. We pivoted to text triggers (Espanso /
TextExpander style) for three reasons:

* **OS hotkey limits.** Windows / macOS / X11 all cap the number
  of registered global hotkeys, and any combo a user might pick
  could already be claimed by the system or another app. Text
  triggers have no such limit — users can have hundreds.
* **Visibility.** A hotkey is invisible state ("did I just press
  Ctrl+Alt+S? what did it do?"). A text trigger is right there in
  your buffer — you see what you typed.
* **Architecture fit.** PolterType already runs a word-boundary
  pipeline for layout corrections. Text triggers slot in BEFORE
  the corrector's filters — same `WordBuffer::feed` boundary
  detection, same `KeyEmitter` for backspace + replay. Zero new
  threads, zero new OS surfaces.

The Hotkeys pane stays as it was (the two built-in pause /
switch-last bindings). The new Commands pane is text-trigger only.

### 2. Trigger lookup before auto-switch filters

The smart-command match runs in `decide()` immediately after the
last_word stash, BEFORE the structural-boundary / disabled-app /
identifier filters. Reasoning: those filters exist to suppress
auto-switching when the engine might be wrong (URL context, IDE
context, code-shaped tokens). Text expansion is direct user intent
("I typed `anrl<space>` because I want it expanded") — the engine
is not guessing. So the suppression rules don't apply.

This makes `=>` work as a trigger inside an IDE, where
`looks_like_code_token` would otherwise veto the whole word.

### 3. v1 action surface kept tiny

Three actions (`type_text`, `switch_layout`, `open_path`).
Deliberately small. `run_shell` was tempting but a stolen config
file becomes a remote-execution vector — separate security review.
Multi-token triggers (`best regards` → `…`) would need a sliding
window across word boundaries we don't have today.

Adding new variants is forward-compat through serde: an old binary
encountering a `type = "future_thing"` entry warns and skips that
single command, the rest still load.

### 4. Inline dispatch on the engine thread

The engine's smart-command path runs `send_backspaces` →
`send_text` (or `switch_to` / `opener::open`) inline. Same thread
as the corrector. All three actions complete in well under 50 ms
on the common path; if a future variant becomes slow (network call,
heavy file I/O) the right call is for THAT variant to spawn a
worker — don't pessimise the fast path.

For `TypeText`, the boundary character is re-emitted after the
expansion so the user's typing flow continues — they typed
`anrl<space>`, they expect `<expansion><space>` to land. For
`SwitchLayout` / `OpenPath` the boundary stays consumed (the user
wanted a side-effect, not text continuation).

### 5. Auto-id from display name

The form auto-generates a kebab-case id from the user's display
name (e.g. `"Insert Email Signature"` → `insert-email-signature`).
Empty name falls back to action-typed ids (`type-text`,
`switch-layout`, `open-path`); collisions append `-2`, `-3`, …
deterministically. Users never need to think about ids — they're
exposed in logs and the saved TOML, but the UI surfaces only
display names.

### 6. Per-app wordlist profiles: cache + swap, not rebuild

Profile activation switches the engine's dictionary set in one
`RwLock::write()` — the same `DictionaryDetector::replace_dicts`
primitive the manual "Reload Settings" path already uses. We
build one cached `HashMap<LayoutId, LayoutDictionary>` per
profile up front and stash the global baseline under the empty-
string key, so a focus transition is always a single map lookup +
atomic swap. Building 5 profiles takes 5×N text-file reads (cheap)
because the bundled FSTs are already `Arc`-shared inside
`LayoutDictionary` — only the per-profile `user_overlay`
HashSets are re-derived.

### 7. Focus watcher: 250 ms poll, not OS event

Same cadence as `spawn_layout_poller` already uses. We considered
hooking each platform's "focus changed" event but the gain
(maybe 100 ms faster swap) doesn't justify three platform
implementations + three failure modes. 250 ms is well below the
"I switched apps" perceptual threshold for wordlist purposes,
which only matters at word-boundary time anyway.

### 8. Profile-list management not in v1 UI

The Wordlists pane gets a Profile picker row (Global + each
configured profile), but adding / removing profiles is editable
only in `config.toml` for v1. Reasoning: the profile-management
form needs name + id + apps-list editor + on-disk-cleanup-on-
delete, that's another 200+ LOC of UI on top of an already-
1500-LOC settings_ui.rs. Once users have feedback on which
shapes of profiles they actually want, building the management
UI on top is straightforward.

### What's still on the bench

* **Hotkey capture on Wayland** — iced's keyboard subscription
  works on Windows / X11 / macOS today; Wayland clients don't
  receive grab-style global events while unfocused. The current
  capture works fine when the Settings window is focused (the
  common case for rebinding) but not from a background "rebind via
  hotkey" gesture. Fine for v1.
* **Plug-in marketplace UX** — installation, signing, updates. The
  loader is ready for them; the UI / network plumbing is a separate
  phase whose security model needs its own DECISIONS entry.
* **Profile-list management UI** — see point 7 above. The schema
  + engine wiring + per-profile wordlist editing are all live;
  add/delete/configure-apps in the GUI is queued.
* **Smart command actions** — `run_shell`, multi-token triggers,
  and case-insensitive / case-preserving expansion are deliberately
  out of v1. Each unlocks a different security or UX surface.

## 2026-07-11 — Correction pipeline v2: absorb → delete → replay, echo match-and-consume

Field reports on v0.1.1: (a) "після автоперемикання лишається перший
символ старого слова", (b) "видаляю пару символів, дописую — коректор
переводить пів слова". Root causes and the redesign that fixes them:

**What was wrong.**

* The engine suppressed *everything* for 300-400 ms after a correction
  (blanket lockout) and cleared the word buffer on every event inside
  the window. A fast typist's first keystrokes of the next word landed
  inside that window: on screen but not in the buffer → the next
  correction under-counted its backspaces → the word head stayed behind.
* Keystrokes racing the emission physically interleave with our
  backspace burst at the compositor: each raced key soaks up one
  backspace meant for the word — same visible symptom.
* The buffer had no model of editing across a word boundary: Backspace
  over the space re-entered the previous word on screen, while the
  buffer tracked a brand-new empty word → tail-only corrections.
* `hyprctl` was spawned as a subprocess per keystroke (layout lookup)
  and 4-5× per correction, stretching the race window to 100 ms+.

**What was decided.**

* **Echo handling** — the emitter records every event it puts on the
  wire (`KeyEmitter::take_emitted`); the engine match-and-consumes
  those echoes off the key stream (ordered queue, lookahead 1 for
  remapper-coalesced events, ~800 ms expiry). Real keystrokes are
  processed normally no matter how soon after a correction. The
  blanket lockout is gone.
* **Absorb-before-delete** — a correction first watches the key stream
  until it has been quiet for ~90 ms (3 × 30 ms probes, 600 ms cap).
  Keys typed meanwhile are absorbed into the plan: deleted together
  with the word, re-typed after the boundary in order, and seeded into
  the buffer as the next word. A boundary stops absorption and is
  re-processed through the normal pipeline afterwards, so the next
  word gets its own decision. Enter/Tab or anything murky (Backspace,
  nav, click, shortcut) aborts the correction before any keystroke is
  emitted.
* **Switch first, delete second** — flipping the layout doesn't touch
  text, so a failed switch now aborts with the word intact (previously
  backspaces had already destroyed it), and its propagation overlaps
  the backspace burst.
* **Word-boundary re-open + poisoning** (`WordBuffer`) — the completed
  word and its run of boundary keys stay stashed; backspacing across
  the boundary re-opens the word (scancodes are layout-independent, so
  this survives our own replays). When the buffer *knows* it lost
  track (BS into unseen text, caret moved mid-word via nav keys or
  mouse click, idle gap mid-word, shortcut mid-word), it taints the
  in-progress word; a tainted completion is never auto-corrected and
  drops the manual-switch stash. Mouse clicks are observed by opening
  BTN_LEFT-capable evdev devices and reporting a pseudo-scancode.
* **Hyprland over IPC socket** — `.socket.sock` request/reply with
  `hyprctl` subprocess as fallback, plus a TTL cache (200 ms current /
  2 s list) in front of every Linux backend. Cuts the per-keystroke
  cost from a process spawn to a mutex read and the pre-correction
  latency from ~100 ms to ~2 ms.

**Alternatives considered.**

* `EVIOCGRAB` during corrections (deterministic, no interleaving) —
  rejected: keyd already holds the grab on this class of setup, and
  grabbing keyd's virtual device would swallow our own replay.
* Wayland `zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1` — still the proper long-term path
  for injection; orthogonal to buffer/absorb logic, tracked separately.

## 2026-07-13 — Linux focus tracking + the tray finally admits hook failures

Two of Phase 6's leftovers closed together, because they share a theme:
things the app silently didn't do on Linux.

**Focus tracking (was: the "quietest hole in the product", PLAN §3.9).**
`create_focus_tracker()` returned `NoopFocusTracker` everywhere except
Windows, so `[exceptions].disabled_apps`, per-app wordlist profiles and
`apps = [...]` scoping on smart commands silently did nothing on Linux.
Decisions made:

* **Two backends, probed in order: Hyprland IPC, then X11 EWMH.**
  Hyprland answers `activewindow` over the same UNIX socket the layout
  switcher already uses (`hyprctl` subprocess as fallback); X11 reads
  `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` on the root, then `_NET_WM_PID` on that window.
  Both are polled synchronously — mirroring the Windows tracker's
  model, where the *callers* provide the cadence — no event thread.
* **The reported identity is the executable basename via
  `/proc/<pid>/exe`**, falling back to `/proc/<pid>/comm`, then the
  window class. That makes the answer the exact analogue of the
  Windows tracker (`QueryFullProcessImageNameW` basename), so
  `disabled_apps` entries behave the same across OSes: `"code"`,
  `"alacritty"` — case-insensitive.
* **A 150 ms TTL cache wraps whichever backend wins.** Unlike the
  Win32 query, our backends are real I/O (socket / X round-trip), and
  `focused_exe()` sits on the engine's word-boundary path plus the
  250 ms profile watcher. One real query per 150 ms window is
  invisible to humans and makes the polling free.
* **XWayland's X server is deliberately NOT used as a fallback on
  non-Hyprland Wayland.** It only sees XWayland windows, so its
  `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` goes stale the moment focus moves to a native
  Wayland window — a wrong answer is worse than `None`. GNOME/KDE on
  Wayland keep the noop tracker until per-DE backends (KWin script /
  GNOME extension) exist.
* The IPC socket helpers are a ~40-line copy of
  `poltertype-layout/src/linux/hyprland/ipc.rs` — those are
  `pub(crate)` there, and a shared crate for this much code isn't
  worth the dependency edge yet. Noted in both files.

**Startup-failure surfacing (was: `warn!` into a log file).** When the
input listener failed to start — Wayland without `input`-group access
being the common case — the tray came up looking perfectly healthy and
the app just did nothing. The listener has returned a descriptive
`InputError` since day one *specifically* so the tray could show an
onboarding banner; the plumbing was the missing half. Now a failure:

* prepends a "⚠ Keyboard hooks unavailable — Setup Guide…" tray menu
  entry that opens `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` on GitHub (pinned to `main`,
  so the guide tracks the latest setup script, not the failed binary);
* appends "⚠ no keyboard access, see Setup Guide" to the tooltip
  (part of `TrayState`, so it survives every tray refresh);
* fires one startup notification through the error-notification path,
  which is deliberately NOT gated by `[general].show_notifications` —
  that toggle governs cosmetic switch chatter, and "the app you just
  launched cannot do its job" is not cosmetic.

The original sketch wanted a "Run setup" button that executes
`setup-linux.sh` directly. Rejected for now: that means the tray
spawning a `sudo`/`pkexec` prompt, which is exactly the scary pattern
the docs warn against — a guide the user reads and runs themselves is
more honest. Revisit if onboarding drop-off proves real.

---

## 2026-07-13 — Auto-update from GitHub Releases

**The app now makes a network call.** That sentence is the whole
weight of this decision, so it goes first. Until now `poltertype`'s
default build never opened a socket, and both `CLAUDE.md` and the
landing page said so in as many words. It now polls GitHub for new
releases, downloads them, and installs them on restart. The rest of
this entry is the reasoning and the boundaries.

### Why do it at all

The installers ship **unsigned** (Apple Developer ID and a Windows
OV/EV cert are Phase 9). An unsigned app with no update channel is
not the conservative choice — it is the worst of both worlds: users
sit on old builds forever, and the only way we can reach them with a
security fix is a blog post they will not read. "No auto-update" is
only the safer option for a project that never needs to ship a fix.

### What is actually sent

Nothing. A `GET` of a static JSON asset on `github.com`, with no
query string, no body, no cookie, no identifier. GitHub learns what
any HTTP server learns — the connecting IP, and a User-Agent naming
the running version. That is the irreducible cost of asking "is there
a newer version", and it is why the whole subsystem is one switch:
`[updates].enabled = false` and the app never opens a socket again.
It is not telemetry, it must never grow into telemetry, and the
Settings pane prints the exact URL so the claim can be checked rather
than believed.

### On by default

Yes — and the landing page's "no network calls" copy changes to match,
because the alternative is a promise the binary does not keep. An
opt-in updater buried in a settings pane is one nobody finds, which
means it protects nobody, which means we would have paid the honesty
cost and bought nothing.

### Trust model, and its limit

HTTPS plus a per-artifact SHA-256 from the release manifest. The
download is streamed through the hasher and only renamed into its
final path once the digest matches; a mismatch deletes the bytes and
aborts. There is a test that a mismatched payload leaves *nothing* on
disk, because the failure we cannot afford is a bad artifact reaching
`msiexec`.

Be precise about what that buys: the checksum comes from the *same
release* as the artifact, so it defeats a corrupted transfer and a
tampered asset CDN, but **not** a compromised GitHub account. Whoever
can publish a release can publish a matching checksum. The defence
against that is a detached signature over the manifest, made with a
key that does not live on GitHub — `Manifest.signature` is reserved
for exactly that (ed25519, minisign-style), and the field parses today
so it can be filled in later as a value change rather than a schema
break. Until then the honest statement is: *we trust GitHub as much as
we trust the account that publishes the releases.*

Considered and deferred: signing now. It was the recommendation; the
maintainer chose checksums for this phase to avoid a key-management
burden (a lost private key means users are stranded with no update
path, permanently). The field is there when we want it.

### Never install under the user's hands

The one hard rule. This app owns a global keyboard hook — replacing
its binary mid-sentence would drop keystrokes at best. So the
background worker only ever *stages*: it downloads, verifies, writes
`pending.json`, and stops. The install happens at a moment the user
chose, and only then:

* they click **Quit** — the hook is already down, so we install and
  don't relaunch (they asked for the app to go away);
* they click **⟳ Restart to update** in the tray — install, relaunch.

That is the Chrome/VS Code model, and it is why the tray entry says
"Restart to update" rather than "Update now".

### Why a script on disk, spawned detached

None of the three platforms can replace a running binary: an MSI
cannot overwrite a locked `.exe`, an AppImage cannot be `mv`-ed over
its own live FUSE mount, a `.app` cannot be `ditto`-ed over itself. So
every backend writes a small script into the staging directory, spawns
it **detached** (own process group on Unix, `DETACHED_PROCESS` on
Windows), and the script's first act is to poll until our PID is gone.
The app then exits normally and the installer runs in the gap.

Paths go into a script *file* rather than onto a command line because
the paths involved are home directories — spaces, apostrophes,
non-ASCII — and nested shell quoting is where that turns into a bug.
One layer of quoting instead of three, and a user can read afterwards
exactly what was run on their machine.

Failed installs are counted in `pending.json` *before* the attempt,
not after: an installer that hard-kills us would never reach an
after-the-fact increment, and the broken artifact would be retried on
every quit forever. Three strikes and the staged update is deleted.

### Platform code in a third crate

`CLAUDE.md` said platform code lives in `poltertype-input` and
`poltertype-layout` and nowhere else. Installing an update is
irreducibly per-OS, so the rule now names three crates:
`poltertype-update` is the third. The intent of the rule — platform
`#[cfg]` confined to dedicated platform crates, never sprinkled through
the engine — is unchanged.

### macOS is written, not verified

The `.app`-swap backend follows Apple's documentation and has never
been run on Apple hardware — macOS is a CI-only target for this project.
It also strips `com.apple.quarantine` from the installed bundle, which
is precisely the flag Gatekeeper sets on a download. That is defensible
only because the app is unsigned and the release notes already tell
first-time users to strip it by hand; the moment we ship notarised
builds, that line comes out. Treat the macOS path as unproven until
someone runs it on a Mac.

## 2026-07-13 — Reversed: no default app skip-list

`[exceptions].disabled_apps` used to ship with ~50 entries — VS Code,
Cursor, the JetBrains family, Sublime, Zed, Neovide, kitty, alacritty,
wezterm, konsole, PowerShell, cmd, tmux. The reasoning (above, and it
still reads well) was that corrupting a function name costs far more
than missing a prose correction inside an IDE.

It shipped broken and nobody noticed, because it never ran. Until the
Linux focus tracker landed, `create_focus_tracker()` returned
`NoopFocusTracker` outside Windows, `focused_exe()` returned `None`,
and the match never fired. The list was inert decoration on every
Linux machine.

Then the Hyprland/X11 tracker arrived and armed it. From the user's
side the app simply stopped working: type a wrong-layout word in
Sublime — nothing. In kitty — nothing. No error, no notification, no
log line above `DEBUG`. The correct diagnosis ("your editor is on a
skip-list you never wrote, and a new focus tracker just started
enforcing it") is not one any user is going to reach; "the layout
switching is broken" is.

So the default is now **empty**, and the reasoning above is demoted
from a shipped default to advice. What actually keeps the corrector
out of code is the per-token guard (`suppress_in_identifiers`), the
plausibility-keep, `min_word_length` and the dictionary confidence
threshold — all of which are engine logic that runs in every app on
every OS, needs no focus tracker, and has no way to make the product
look dead. A skip-list is a blunt instrument the user can pick up if
they want it; it is not something we hand them pre-loaded and aimed at
their own editor.

The general lesson is worth more than the specific fix: **a default
whose only saving grace is that it doesn't execute is not a default,
it is a landmine.** When a dormant feature (here: focus tracking) is
implemented for a new platform, every config default gated behind it
changes behaviour on that platform — audit them as part of the same
change, not after a user reports the product as broken.

## 2026-07-24 — Spelling suggestions: surface FSTs, a DFA that survives Cyrillic, and a focus-free tooltip

The engine's promise was "your wrong-layout word gets fixed"; plain
typos (`слоао`, `hwllo`) got nothing. Suggestions close that gap:
when a completed word is kept by the decision pipeline **and** is not
in the current language's dictionary, the engine offers nearby
dictionary words in a small tooltip — click one, or press
`Ctrl+Shift+<digit>`, and the word is replaced in place. On by
default (`[suggestions]`), purely local, and the typed text never
reaches a log line — only counts do.

**A second, surface-form FST per language.** The membership FSTs are
built with the lossy `letters_only_lower` normalisation — `п'ять` is
stored as `пять`, which is fine for "is this a word?" and fatal for
"type this word into the user's text". `build.rs` now also emits
`<stem>-surface.fst` (lowercase, apostrophes folded to `'`, hyphens
kept), and suggestions stream off that one, so `пять` comes back as
`п'ять`. One decoding pass produces both shapes; ≤2-letter surface
entries are dropped (suggestions never target short tokens). Cost:
~2-4 MB per language on disk and resident, only for loaded layouts.

**`levenshtein_automata`, not fst's `levenshtein` feature.** The
candidate walk intersects the surface FST with an edit-distance
automaton (d=1, then d=2 for tokens ≥5 letters when d=1 found
little). fst 0.4's own Levenshtein automaton silently mismatches
multibyte queries — even `слово` within d=1 *of itself* streams zero
results — which rules it out for a Cyrillic-first product. The
tantivy crate handles UTF-8 correctly and counts adjacent
transpositions as one edit, which matches how humans mistype. The
parametric tables build once per Suggester; per-query DFAs are cheap.

**Keyboard-aware ranking.** Raw candidates are re-ranked by a
weighted optimal-string-alignment distance: substituting a key by its
*physical neighbour* costs ~0.4 instead of 1.0 (positions derived
from Set-1 scancodes — layout-independent physics, per-layout char
maps), transpositions 0.6, plus small first/last-letter and
shared-prefix signals, and a penalty for weak-list entries. So
`hwllo` prefers `hello` (w↔e adjacent) over `hallo`, with no
frequency data needed.

**Below-threshold layout verdicts get a second life.** A Switch
verdict whose confidence missed `confidence_threshold` used to be
dropped on the floor. It is now the *leading* tooltip entry, badged
with the target layout; accepting it runs the full switch-and-replay
correction. The engine stays conservative automatically while the
user gets to overrule it with one click.

**The tooltip must never take keyboard focus**, or it would break the
very typing it exists to fix. New `poltertype-popup` crate (a fourth
platform-code island alongside input/layout/update): Wayland uses a
`wlr-layer-shell` overlay with `keyboard_interactivity: None`
(Hyprland/Sway; GNOME/KDE expose no layer-shell to third parties →
noop), X11 an override-redirect window, macOS/Windows are noop seams
for now. Rendering is tiny-skia + cosmic-text — both already in the
tree via iced's software renderer, so no new licences.

**Anchoring: AT-SPI caret first, proxies after.** The tooltip sits
next to the text-insertion point via an anchor chain, best first:

1. **AT-SPI caret extents** — a background watcher (zbus *blocking*,
   no async runtime; the long-lived signal subscription is why this
   is a real bus connection while `poltertype-layout` stays on CLI
   shell-outs) subscribes to `object:text-caret-moved` and resolves
   each event through `GetCharacterExtents`. Extents are requested
   **window-relative** (`ATSPI_COORD_TYPE_WINDOW`) and composed with
   the compositor's live window rect — native-Wayland toolkits
   report *screen* coordinates against the window's initial
   placement, which goes stale on every re-tile (observed live).
   The watcher also raises `org.a11y.Status.IsEnabled` (after the
   a11y-bus handshake — a write during `at-spi-bus-launcher`
   activation gets overwritten by its initial state): toolkits keep
   their a11y bridge dormant until an AT client raises that flag,
   and PolterType now is one. Apps already running before the flag
   went up stay silent until restarted — accepted; the chain
   degrades per-app, not globally.
2. **Pointer inside the focused window** (Hyprland `cursorpos` / X11
   `QueryPointer`) — after a click into the text, the pointer hovers
   near the caret.
3. **Focused window rect** (Hyprland IPC `activewindow` now parsed
   for `at:`/`size:`/`monitor:`; X11 `GetGeometry` +
   `TranslateCoordinates`), bottom-centre — chat inputs and prompts.
4. **Output bottom edge** when nothing is known.

Around the anchor point the popup walks the sides by preference —
above → below → right → left, first side with room wins, clamped to
the output with a margin (`poltertype-popup/src/place.rs`, pure and
unit-tested). "Above" clears the caret line's top, "below" its
bottom, so the line being typed is never covered.

**A click on the tooltip races its own observation.** The engine
watches mouse buttons (BTN_LEFT evdev pseudo-scancode) and treats a
click as "caret moved" — which would kill the very offer the click
is accepting, since the popup's `Accepted` event arrives through
another thread. Resolution: when a pointer press lands while an
offer is live, the engine *freezes* the screen model (word +
separators + in-progress tail) into the offer for a ~500 ms grace
window instead of dropping it. A click ON the overlay never reached
the app below, so the frozen state is exactly what's on screen; an
accept inside the grace applies from it, and the correction's absorb
machinery is granted exactly one benign pointer-press allowance for
whichever ordering the race produced. A click *elsewhere* is voided
by the first following keypress or the grace lapsing. Bare modifier
presses no longer count as "commands" (`is_modifier_scancode`) — on
the Linux listener a modifier's own press already carries its flag,
and `Ctrl↓` was killing the accept chord before its digit arrived;
an idle-timeout carve-out similarly keeps a live offer's word stash
valid while the user pauses to read the tooltip.

**Accept paths and their races.** Tooltip clicks arrive as
`EngineCommand::AcceptSuggestion { generation, index }`; the digit
chord is matched straight off the key stream on *every* platform
(registering nine OS-global hotkeys would steal those combos from
every app even with no tooltip up; stream matching costs one mutex
peek and only while an offer is pending). Every offer carries a
monotonic generation; an accept is honoured only if the generation
matches, the deadline hasn't passed, and the buffer's completed-word
stash still equals the offered word's scancodes — so a stale click
can never replace the wrong text. The replacement itself reuses
`apply_correction` wholesale (absorb window, echo bookkeeping,
compensation loop), with `from == to` skipping the layout-switch
pre-flight and the `Corrected`/`LayoutChanged` events. Suggestion
text is typed as reverse-mapped scancodes (the only injection that
works in terminals); characters the layout can't type (uk apostrophe)
fall back to `send_text`.

**Known trade-offs, accepted deliberately:**

* The accept chord's keypress still reaches the focused app (we
  never block keys) — same accepted risk as the Wayland hotkeys;
  `Ctrl+Shift+digit` is bound by virtually nothing.
* An offer dies when the *next* word completes — the tooltip's
  full 30 s apply only while the word is still the last thing the
  buffer can vouch for. A tooltip that outlives its ability to act
  would be lying about clickability.
* Overlay-only words are suggested in their stripped form (user
  overlays are stored `letters_only_lower`); acceptable for the
  project-jargon lists overlays hold.

**Alternatives considered.** An iced/winit popup window — rejected:
winit can't position toplevels on Wayland at all, and a normal
window steals focus. `zwp_input_method_v2` for real caret rects —
rejected for now: only one IM client may bind it (fcitx users lose),
and it drags a whole input-method identity with it. SymSpell-style
precomputed deletion tables — unnecessary: FST∩DFA already answers
in microseconds at our dictionary sizes without a second index.

**"Add to dictionary" closes the loop.** Field feedback within the
first hour: the tooltip fires on everything the dictionaries don't
know — jargon, names, project vocabulary. The remedy is in the
tooltip itself: a set-apart last row (divider, accent colour) that
appends the word to the user's global overlay file and inserts it
into the running dictionary set **in place** (`add_overlay_word` —
one HashSet insert; a full from-disk reload would re-read and, via
the `&'static` FST plumbing, re-leak every dictionary blob per added
word). The engine only emits `AddToDictionary { layout, word }`; the
app owns the file and the swap. The row rides along only when a
tooltip would show anyway — a popup whose sole content is "add to
dictionary" would itself be the noise it exists to stop.

**Words started mid-text get no tooltip.** Typing right after a
click / arrow keys / Esc means the caret may sit inside a word the
buffer never saw; the typed keys are then a *fragment*, suggestions
computed on a fragment are noise, and accepting one splices the
replacement into the middle of the on-screen word. `WordBuffer` now
records whether each word's first key arrived after an *observed*
separator (`started_clean` on `WordCompleted`), and the engine
offers suggestions only for clean starts. Deliberate asymmetry:
auto layout-correction is NOT gated on this — correcting a
wrong-layout fragment right after clicking into a field is
long-standing, test-pinned behaviour, and the dictionary Keep
protects valid fragments there. Cost accepted: the first word typed
after a click into an empty field misses its tooltip; every word
after it is covered.
