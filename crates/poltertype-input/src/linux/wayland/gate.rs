//! `EvdevGate` — holds the user's keystrokes back from applications
//! while a correction burst is on the wire.
//!
//! A correction is a burst of injected keys, and the compositor
//! interleaves whatever the user types into it. Counting cannot undo
//! that afterwards, so the only real fix is to stop the user's keys
//! from reaching applications until our burst has landed —
//! `EVIOCGRAB`, the evdev equivalent of what a Windows low-level hook
//! does by swallowing events. We keep reading the grabbed devices, so
//! the engine still sees every keystroke and replays them behind the
//! correction, in order.
//!
//! Two things make this safe enough to enable by default:
//!
//! * **The device thread owns the grab, not the caller.** It drops the
//!   hold once [`MAX_HOLD`] elapses whatever the engine is doing, so a
//!   hung or panicking correction cannot leave the keyboard dead. A
//!   crashed process is safe by construction — the kernel releases the
//!   grab when the descriptors close.
//! * **It refuses to run where it would gag us instead.** See
//!   [`EvdevGate::probe_availability`].
